modified version to 0.0.9 relese
added a bit of javadoc to Interpolators factory class, but it should be removed because it shouldnt be used
removed java2d interpolators not used any more
removed unused class InterpolatorProvider and its test
added a bit of javadoc to TimelineValueBuilder, changed it to cache the keyframes and then build the TimelineVAlue on build() method, added a test to show timeline is not generating garbage between iterpolations of keyframes
modified other tests to use a TypeConverter when building the TimelineValue too
fixed tests by passing the TypeConverter to the TimelineValueBuilder
modified TimelineValue to use KeyFrames of float[] instead a generic T value and modified TimelineValueBuilder to use a typeconverter and keyframe() method to let the user specify the InterpolationFunction to use
started refactro to use float[] in timeline keyframes too
modified InterpolatorFunctionFactory to InterpolationFunctions (same as the other factories)
modified cubic and quadratic functions too
modified name of linear interpolator function to linear interpolation function
modified name of InterpolatorFunction to InterpolationFunction
added the missing transition method for the factory
added init() static methods to converters classes to register common classes for the corresponding library in the Converters map, to be used when detecting a converter given a type
added more Transitions factory methods
added transition(startvalue) for the Transitions factory that will look for the corresponding already registered converter
encapsulated the method to register a converter for a given type and made private the converters map
added test for static registered converters
removed some javadoc
added one more test for isTransitioning method, and changed some test names
changed isFinished() method to isTransitioning() and changed behaviour too (take a look at the test)
changed default transition speed to be public static field
added isFinished() method to Transition interface
removed AnimationStateMachine class
removed setCurrentState method from StateMachine API
removed unused setCurrentState calls
added initial state to StateMachine constructor
modified version to development 0.0.9-SNAPSHOT
